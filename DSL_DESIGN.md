# Haverscript Domain Specific Language

First, let's consider several different Python APIs for accessing LLMs.

### Using Ollama's Python API

From <https://github.com/ollama/ollama-python>


```python
import ollama

stream = ollama.chat(
    model='llama3.1',
    messages=[
        {
            'role': 'user', 
            'content': 'Why is the sky blue?'
        }
    ],
    stream=True,
)

for chunk in stream:
  print(chunk['message']['content'], end='', flush=True)
```

### Using Mistral's Python API

From <https://docs.mistral.ai/getting-started/clients/>

```python
import os
from mistralai import Mistral

api_key = os.environ["MISTRAL_API_KEY"]
model = "mistral-large-latest"

client = Mistral(api_key=api_key)

chat_response = client.chat.complete(
    model = model,
    messages = [
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "What is the best French cheese?",
        },
    ]
)

print(chat_response.choices[0].message.content)
```

### Using LiteLLM's Python API

From <https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm>

```python
from litellm import acompletion
import asyncio

async def test_get_response():
    user_message = "Hello, how are you?"
    messages = [{"content": user_message, "role": "user"}]
    response = await acompletion(model="gpt-3.5-turbo", messages=messages)
    return response

response = asyncio.run(test_get_response())
print(response)
```

### LangChain (Using Ollama)

From <https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/integrations/llms/ollama/>,
with output parser from <https://python.langchain.com/v0.1/docs/get_started/quickstart/>.

```python
from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate
from langchain_ollama.llms import OllamaLLM
from langchain_core.output_parsers import StrOutputParser

template = """Question: {question}

Answer: Let's think step by step."""

prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template(template)

model = OllamaLLM(model="llama3.1")

output_parser = StrOutputParser()

chain = prompt | model | output_parser

chain.invoke({"question": "What is LangChain?"})
```

All these examples are more verbose than necessary for such simple tasks.

## A Domain Specific Language for talking to LLMs

A Domain Specific Language (DSL) is an interface to a capability. A good LLM DSL
should have composable parts that work together to make accessing the
capabilities of LLMs robust, straightforward, and predictable.

So, when we want to connect to a specific LLM, ask a question, and print a
result, we do the following:

```python
from haverscript import connect

print(connect("mistral").chat("What is a haver?"))
```

---

What about having a chat session? Turn on echo, and chat away.

```python
from haverscript import connect

session = connect("mistral").echo()
session = session.chat("In one sentence, why is the sky blue?")
session = session.chat("Rewrite the above sentence in the style of Yoda")
session = session.chat("How many questions did I ask?")
...
```

---

What about using the result in a later prompt? Use a Python f-string to
describe the second prompt.

```python
from haverscript import connect

model = connect("mistral").echo()

best = model.chat("Name the best basketball player. Only name one player and do not give commentary.")

model.chat(f"Someone told me that {best} is the best basketball player. Do you agree, and why?")
```

These examples demonstrate how Haverscript's components are designed to be
composable, making it easy to build upon previous interactions.

## Principles of Haverscript as a DSL

Haverscript is built around five core principles:

**LLM Interactions as String-to-String Operations**

Interactions with LLMs in Haverscript are fundamentally string-based. Pythonâ€™s
robust string formatting tools, such as  `.format` and f-strings, are used
directly. Prompts can be crafted using f-strings with explicit `{...}` notation
for injection. The `chat` method accepts prompt strings and returns a result
that can be seamlessly used in other f-strings, or accessed through the `.reply`
attribute. This makes the "string plumbing" for prompt-based applications an
integral part of the Haverscript domain-specific design.

**Immutable Core Structures**

The primary classes in Haverscript are immutable, similar to Python strings or
tuples. Managing state is as simple as assigning names to things. For example,
running the same prompt multiple times on the same context is straightforward
because there is no hidden state that might be updated.

**LLM Call Caching**

All LLM calls can be cached in a [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/) database. If
a query with identical context and parameters has been generated before, the
cached result can be reused. This allows for deep scripting, efficient session
management, and instant replay of interactions.

**Response Rejection and Reruns**

Rejecting a specific response and rerunning an LLM request is built-in, using
the post-condition hook `check`. This hook interacts with the cache, allowing
for cache invalidation when necessary. check predicates are simply Python
functions that return a bool, making it easy to assert specific conditions and
re-execute when needed.

**Echo Mode for Interactive Use and Debugging**

Haverscript includes an echo mode, which shows interactions in markdown-style
format in real-time, This allows a Haverscript program to function similarly to
a traditional LLM chat session, making it a useful tool for both development and
live interaction.
