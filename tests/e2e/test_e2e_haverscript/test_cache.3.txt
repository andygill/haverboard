reply:  The sky appears blue due to a process called Rayleigh scattering where shorter-wavelength light (blue light) is scattered more effectively than longer-wavelength light (red light), making the sky appear blue during daytime.

reply:  The sky appears blue because molecules in our atmosphere scatter sunlight more strongly in shorter wavelengths (blue and violet), while sun's brightness in these wavelengths is relatively higher, causing them to be scattered preferentially, and us seeing the sky as blue.
