> In one sentence, why is the sky blue?

The sky appears blue because of a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering, in
which shorter (blue) wavelengths of light are scattered more than longer (red)
wavelengths by the tiny molecules of gases in the Earth's atmosphere,
resulting in the blue color we see.

> What color is the sky on Mars?

The color of the sky on Mars is a topic of ongoing research and debate. NASA's
Curiosity rover has been studying the Martian atmosphere and has taken
numerous images of the Martian sky. The color of the sky on Mars is often
described as a pale orange or reddish hue, which is due to the presence of
iron oxide (rust) particles in the Martian soil and dust. The sky can also
appear more hazy or dusty due to the frequent dust storms that occur on the
planet. However, the exact shade of the Martian sky can vary depending on the
time of day, the amount of dust in the air, and other factors.

> Do any other planets have blue skies?

Yes, some other planets and moons in our solar system have blue skies,
although they may not be as blue as Earth's. Here are a few examples:

1. Neptune: Like Earth, Neptune's atmosphere scatters sunlight in a way that
makes it appear blue, giving it a blue-gray color.
2. Uranus: Uranus's atmosphere is mostly composed of hydrogen, helium, and
methane, which scatters light in a way that produces a pale blue color.
3. Saturn's moon, Titan: Titan's thick atmosphere is rich in nitrogen and
methane, which scatters light in a way that gives it a hazy, orange-brown
color. However, when the sun is low on the horizon, Titan's sky can take on a
blueish hue.
4. Venus: Although Venus's thick atmosphere is often shrouded in sulfuric acid
clouds, when the sun is high in the sky, the clouds can take on a blueish tint
due to the scattering of sunlight by the sulfuric acid droplets.

It's worth noting that these blue skies are not necessarily identical to
Earth's blue sky, as the atmospheric conditions and composition of these
planets and moons are quite different from our own.
