> In one sentence, why is the sky blue?

The sky appears blue during a clear day because molecules in Earth's
atmosphere scatter sunlight in all directions and short-wavelength light like
blue and violet is scattered more due to its smaller wavelength. However, we
perceive the sky as blue and not violet since our eyes are more sensitive to
blue light and the scattered blue light reaches us from every direction while
the scattered violet light is scattered even more and is removed from our line
of sight by a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering.
