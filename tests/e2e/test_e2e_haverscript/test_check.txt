> In one sentence, why is the sky blue?

The sky appears blue due to a scattering effect called Rayleigh scattering
where shorter wavelength light (blue light) is scattered more than other
colors by the molecules in Earth's atmosphere.

Blue, the sky seems due to scatter, it does. Shorter-wavelength light (blue
light), more than others, by molecules in our atmosphere, it is scattered
extensively.
